defmodule PidroServerWeb.API.ProfileController do
  @moduledoc """
  API controller for the player profile screen.

  Serves the currently authenticated user's full profile in a single read:
  headline lifetime stats, skill tier + provisional state, veteran level/XP/
  title/progress, heritage badges, playstyle (aggression meter + avg winning
  bid), and mastery achievements.

  ## Authentication

  Requires a valid Bearer token in the Authorization header:
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Validated via the Authenticate plug, which
  assigns `conn.assigns.current_user`.

  ## Skill is μ/σ-free

  The raw rating internals (`rating_mu`, `rating_sigma`, `rating_games_count`)
  are NEVER exposed. They feed `Rating.Tier.classify/1` server-side and are
  dropped by the fail-closed allowlist in `Profiles.public_profile/1`; only
  `skill: %{tier, provisional}` ships.

  ## OpenAPI Documentation

  - GET /api/v1/profile - Get current user's full profile screen

  All endpoints are tagged with "Profiles" in the OpenAPI specification.

    Retrieves the full profile screen for the currently authenticated user in a
    single read.

    This endpoint requires authentication. The Bearer token must be included in
    the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

    Returns:
    - Headline lifetime stats (games/wins/losses/win_rate, first_seen, account age)
    - Skill (`tier` + `provisional` state)
    - Veteran progression (level, XP, title, progress)
    - Heritage badges (display list)
    - Playstyle (bidding win rate, aggression meter + label, avg winning bid)
    - Mastery achievements (earned + active catalog with an `earned` flag)

    The raw rating internals (μ/σ and the rated-game count) are intentionally
    NOT exposed — only the derived skill `tier` + `provisional` state. The
    exclusion is enforced by a fail-closed allowlist in the Profiles context.
