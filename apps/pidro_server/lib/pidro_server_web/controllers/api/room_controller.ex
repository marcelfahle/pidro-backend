defmodule PidroServerWeb.API.RoomController do
  @moduledoc """
  API controller for game room operations.

  This controller handles all room-related endpoints including listing rooms,
  creating new rooms, retrieving room details, and managing player join/leave
  operations. All operations are delegated to the RoomManager GenServer for
  centralized state management.

  ## Authentication

  The following endpoints require authentication (valid Bearer token):
  - `create/2` - Creating a room requires the current user
  - `join/2` - Joining a room requires the current user
  - `leave/2` - Leaving a room requires the current user
  - `create_invite/2` - Minting an invite link; host only (R1, KD5)
  - `seat/2`, `lock/2`, `kick/2` - Host controls for waiting rooms (R23)

  Unauthenticated endpoints:
  - `index/2` - Listing rooms is publicly available
  - `show/2` - Viewing room details is publicly available

  ## Error Handling

  All errors are delegated to the FallbackController for centralized error
  handling. Common error responses include:
  - `{:error, :room_not_found}` - Room code doesn't exist (404)
  - `{:error, :room_full}` - Room already has 4 players (422)
  - `{:error, :already_in_room}` - Player is already in another room (422)
  - `{:error, :not_in_room}` - Player is not in any room (404)
  - `{:error, :table_locked}` - The host locked the table (423)
  - `{:error, :kicked}` - The caller was kicked from this room (403)
  - `{:error, :room_not_waiting}` - A host control outside `:waiting`/`:ready` (409)

      Adds the authenticated player to a room. The player can only be in one room
      at a time. A full waiting room starts only after every human confirms readiness.
      In a playing room, this explicit command claims an owner-opened substitute
      seat. Successful admission ends any spectator membership atomically; game
      channel joins/reconnects never claim unowned seats.

      A block in either direction with the host answers 422 `SEAT_TAKEN`, including
      automatic seat assignment and substitutes. Blocks with non-hosts do not prevent admission.

      A locked table answers 423 `TABLE_LOCKED`; a user the host kicked answers
      403 `KICKED`; and a guest answers 403 `ACCOUNT_REQUIRED`. Limited at policy
      `room_join` (per user).

      An open seat's `min_games` checks the combined Classic and Pidro 2 record.
      Below the bar: 403 `{"error":"SEAT_REQUIRES_GAMES","min_games":100,"games_played":40}`.
      Reclaims, bots and substitutes in playing rooms do not check it.
      A failed profile lookup refuses admission with 503 `PROFILE_UNAVAILABLE`.

      A seat with `password: true` needs the table's seat password in the body's
      `password`. Missing or wrong: 403 `SEAT_REQUIRES_PASSWORD`. Every join that
      sends a password counts against policies `seat_password` (per user) and
      `seat_password_room` (per room); over either, 429. A seat held for the
      caller and a reclaim after a disconnect need no password.

  Creates a new game room.

  Requires authentication via Bearer token.

  Returns HTTP 201 (Created) on success.

  ## Parameters

    * `conn` - The Plug.Conn connection struct (must have :current_user assigned).
      The request body is parsed by `PidroServer.Games.Room.Config.parse_create_params/1`,
      which documents the grammar. Every field is optional:
      - `name` - Room name, at most 60 characters
      - `seats` - `seat_2`, `seat_3` and `seat_4`, each `"ai"` or `"open"`
      - `bot_difficulty` - Deprecated compatibility field; new clients should omit it.
        Legacy `"random"`, `"basic"` and `"smart"` all use the same rulebook.
    * `_params` - Unused. The merged params also carry query-string keys, which
      must not count as unknown body fields.

  Any other body key, including a `room` wrapper, and any invalid value answers
  HTTP 422 with one error per problem and the field path as its `code`. A
  rejected request creates no room and starts no bot.

  ## Headers Required

      Authorization: Bearer <token>

  ## Request Body Example

      {
        "name": "Fun Game Night",
        "seats": {"seat_2": "ai", "seat_3": "open", "seat_4": "ai"},
