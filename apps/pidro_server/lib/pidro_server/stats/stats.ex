  Builds per-player bidding facts from the live `GameState.events` log + the
  room's `seats` at game completion (PID-51).

  The `events` list is appended-only across the whole game, so it holds one
  `{:bidding_complete, position, amount}` per hand (the winning seat + amount).
  This pure folder reads ONLY `:bidding_complete` events:

    * **attempts** — every human-resolved seat participates in every hand's
      bidding, so each such user's `attempts` == the number of `:bidding_complete`
      events (the hand count). A player who left mid-game is still attributed to
      their seat's resolved id for the whole game (same FINAL-seat-state
      attribution `build_player_results/3` uses).
    * **wins / won_bid_sum** — for each `:bidding_complete{position, amount}`,
      resolve `position → user_id` via `seats` (reusing `classify_seat/1`); if it
      resolves to a human, increment that user's `wins` by 1 and `won_bid_sum` by
      `amount`. Positions resolving to a bot (no user_id) contribute nothing.

  Returns `%{user_id => %{"attempts" => n, "wins" => m, "won_bid_sum" => s}}`
  (string keys, mirroring the JSONB round-trip shape). Users who participated but
  never won a bid still get a row (`wins: 0, won_bid_sum: 0`).

  Tolerant base case: `events` not a list, `seats` not a map, or no
  `:bidding_complete` present → `%{}` (legacy / bot-only / missing — contributes
  zero on accumulate and rebuild).
