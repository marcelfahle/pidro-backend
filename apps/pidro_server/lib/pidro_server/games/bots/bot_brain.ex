  Executes a bot move: fetches legal actions, builds the bot's seat view,
  picks an action via the strategy, resolves it, and applies it.

  The strategy only ever sees the seat view (`Pidro.Core.SeatView`), never the
  full game state. The full state is used for one thing: resolving the dealer's
  `{:select_hand, :choose_6_cards}` marker, which is the engine's own choice
  from the pool the dealer legitimately sees.

  A strategy that raises or chooses an illegal action does not stop the turn:
  the move falls back to the rulebook's safest legal action and the failure
  is logged.

  `bot_label` is used for log messages (e.g., "BotPlayer" or "SubstituteBot").
  SubstituteBot supplies RoomManager's PID-checked action function; BotPlayer
  retains direct GameAdapter application.
