  @moduledoc """
  Per-user profile + progression rollup.

  One row per user, created lazily. Holds lifetime play counters (maintained
  incrementally on game completion, rebuildable from game_stats history) plus
  progression columns that later tickets compute (rating, veteran, playstyle,
  heritage). PID-44 only owns the lifetime counters; progression columns ship
  with defaults and are written by PID-45..PID-51.
