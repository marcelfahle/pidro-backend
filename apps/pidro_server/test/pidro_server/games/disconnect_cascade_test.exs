defmodule PidroServer.Games.DisconnectCascadeTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests for the three-phase disconnect cascade.

  Phase 1 (Hiccup): Player disconnects → seat becomes :reconnecting → timer scheduled
  Phase 2 (Grace): Hiccup timer fires → bot spawned → seat becomes :bot_substitute
  Phase 3 (Gone): Grace timer fires → bot becomes permanent → seat no longer reclaimable

  These tests verify Phase 1 behavior: disconnect triggers :reconnecting state,
  PubSub events are broadcast, reconnect during Phase 1 restores the seat,
  and phase timers are properly scheduled and cancelled.
