defmodule Pidro.Core.Events do
  @moduledoc """
  Event sourcing system for the Pidro game engine.

  This module provides structured event handling for reconstructing game state
  from a sequence of events. Every state-changing action in the game produces
  an event that can be replayed to reconstruct the exact game state.

  ## Event Types

  Events are categorized by game phase:

  ### Setup Phase
  - `:dealer_selected` - Initial dealer determined by deck cut
  - `:cards_dealt` - Initial 9-card deal to all players

  ### Bidding Phase
  - `:bid_made` - Player makes a bid (6-14)
  - `:player_passed` - Player passes on bidding
  - `:bidding_complete` - Bidding phase ends with winner

  ### Trump Declaration Phase
  - `:trump_declared` - Winning bidder declares trump suit
  - `:cards_discarded` - Player discards non-trump cards
  - `:second_deal_complete` - Final deal to 6 cards, dealer robs pack
  - `:dealer_robbed_pack` - Dealer takes pack and selects final hand

  ### Playing Phase
  - `:card_played` - Player plays a trump card
  - `:trick_won` - Trick complete, winner determined
  - `:player_went_cold` - Player eliminated (out of trumps)

  ### Scoring Phase
  - `:hand_scored` - Hand complete, scores calculated
  - `:game_won` - Game complete, winning team determined

  ## Event Structure

  Each event is represented as an `Event` struct containing:
  - `type` - The event type atom
  - `data` - Event-specific data (varies by type)
  - `timestamp` - When the event occurred
  - `hand_number` - Which hand this event belongs to

  ## Event Sourcing

  Game state can be reconstructed by replaying events:

      iex> events = [
      ...>   %Event{type: :dealer_selected, data: {:north, {14, :hearts}}, hand_number: 1},
      ...>   %Event{type: :cards_dealt, data: %{north: [...], ...}, hand_number: 1}
      ...> ]
      iex> final_state = Enum.reduce(events, GameState.new(), &Events.apply_event/2)

  ## Immutability

  All event applications are immutable - they return a new GameState without
  modifying the original. This enables:
  - Safe concurrent reads
  - Time-travel debugging
  - Undo/redo functionality
  - State snapshots at any point

  @doc """
  Applies a single event to a GameState and returns the updated state.

  This function pattern matches on event types and applies the appropriate
  state transformations. Events are expected to be in the tuple format
  defined in `Pidro.Core.Types.event()`.

  ## Parameters

  - `state` - Current GameState
  - `event` - Event tuple to apply (from Types.event())

  ## Returns

  Updated `GameState.t()` with the event applied.

  ## Event Types Handled

  ### Dealer Selection
  - `{:dealer_selected, position, card}` - Sets current_dealer

  ### Dealing
  - `{:cards_dealt, hands}` - Distributes cards to players

  ### Bidding
  - `{:bid_made, position, amount}` - Records bid, updates highest_bid
  - `{:player_passed, position}` - Records pass
  - `{:bidding_complete, position, amount}` - Sets bidding winner and team

  ### Trump Declaration
  - `{:trump_declared, suit}` - Sets trump suit

  ### Discarding
  - `{:cards_discarded, position, cards}` - Removes cards from player's hand
  - `{:second_deal_complete, hands}` - Updates hands with final cards
  - `{:dealer_robbed_pack, position, received, kept}` - Dealer selects final hand

  ### Playing
  - `{:card_played, position, card}` - Adds card to current trick
  - `{:trick_won, position, points}` - Completes trick, awards points
  - `{:player_went_cold, position, revealed}` - Eliminates player

  ### Scoring
  - `{:hand_scored, team, points}` - Updates cumulative scores
  - `{:game_won, team, score}` - Sets winner, marks game complete
