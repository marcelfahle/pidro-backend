defmodule Pidro.Core.SeatView do
  @moduledoc """
  What one seat is allowed to know about a game.

  A seat view is the only input a bot strategy may decide from. It is its own
  data shape, not a `GameState`: the viewer's hand, a public record for every
  seat, and the public table fields. Hidden information is absent rather than
  blanked, so another seat's hand is a count (`players[pos].hand_count`), never
  an empty list that could be mistaken for "holds nothing". `GameState` stays
  reserved for authoritative transitions; a view cannot be fed to the engine.

  The view is built from an allow-list of public fields, so a field added to
  `GameState` later stays hidden until it is added here on purpose. Trick and
  scoring helpers such as `Pidro.Game.Play.determine_trick_winner/2` and
  `Pidro.Finnish.Scorer` take tricks and trump suits, so they run on a view's
  fields directly.

  ## What a seat can see

  - Its own hand.
  - Bids, trump, tricks played, the current trick, and the scores.
  - How many cards each non-dealer drew in the second deal (`cards_requested`).
  - Cards revealed by a player who went cold, and cards killed this hand.
  - How many cards every seat holds.
  - The dealer's rob pool, but only for the dealer during a manual rob.

  ## What stays hidden

  Other seats' hands, the deck, the discards, the dealer's pool size, and the
  raw event log. The event log carries every dealt, second-dealt and discarded
  card and is never reset between hands, so no part of it is exposed.

  Builds the view of `state` from the seat at `position`.

  ## Parameters

  - `state` - The full, authoritative game state
  - `position` - The seat whose view to build

  ## Returns

  A `SeatView` holding the viewer's hand, a `PublicPlayer` per seat, the
  public table fields, the kills of the current hand (see `killed_cards/1`),
  and, for the dealer during a manual rob, the rob pool.

  Returns the cards each seat killed in the current hand.

  The engine's `killed_cards` field is recomputed after every play and is
  empty from the second card of a hand onward, so this reads the
  `:cards_killed` events instead. It takes, per seat, the first non-empty
  entry recorded since the hand's `:cards_dealt` event.

  ## Parameters

  - `state` - The full game state

  ## Returns

  A map of position to killed cards; seats that killed nothing are absent.
