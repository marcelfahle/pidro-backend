defmodule Pidro.Finnish.Scorer do
  @moduledoc """
  Scoring logic for Finnish Pidro.

  This module handles all scoring operations including:
  - Scoring individual tricks with the special 2 of trump rule
  - Aggregating team scores from completed tricks
  - Applying bid results (success/failure) to cumulative scores
  - Determining game completion and winners

  ## Finnish Pidro Scoring Rules

  ### Point Distribution
  - Total available points per hand: 14
  - Points are awarded based on cards captured in tricks
  - The special 2 of trump rule affects point distribution

  ### The 2 of Trump Rule
  The 2 of trump has unique scoring behavior:
  - The player who plays the 2 of trump ALWAYS keeps 1 point
  - This point does NOT go to the trick winner
  - The trick winner receives all other points in the trick

  ### Bid Results
  After all tricks are played, scores are applied based on the bidding team's performance:

  **Bidding Team Made Bid:**
  - If points taken >= bid amount: score the points taken

  **Bidding Team Failed Bid:**
  - If points taken < bid amount: lose the bid amount (can go negative)

  **Defending Team:**
  - Always keep the points they took, regardless of bid outcome

  ### Game Completion
  - Game ends when any team reaches 62 points
  - If both teams reach 62 on the same hand, the bidding team wins
  - Scores can go negative if bidding team fails their bid

  Scores a single trick, handling the special 2 of trump rule.

  The 2 of trump is unique in Finnish Pidro:
  - The player who plays it always keeps 1 point
  - That point does NOT go to the trick winner
  - The trick winner gets all other points

  ## Parameters
  - `trick` - A completed `Trick.t()` struct with all plays
  - `trump_suit` - The declared trump suit for this hand

  ## Returns
  A map containing:
  - `:winner` - Position of the player who won the trick
  - `:winner_points` - Points awarded to trick winner (excluding 2 of trump)
  - `:two_of_trump_player` - Position of player who played 2 of trump (or `nil`)
  - `:two_of_trump_points` - Points kept by 2 player (1 if played, 0 otherwise)
