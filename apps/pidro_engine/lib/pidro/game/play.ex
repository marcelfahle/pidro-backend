defmodule Pidro.Game.Play do
  @moduledoc """
  Card playing and trick management for the Finnish Pidro variant.

  This module handles all aspects of the playing phase, including:
  - Playing cards from a player's hand
  - Validating card plays (must be trump in Finnish variant)
  - Completing tricks and determining winners
  - Eliminating players who go "cold" (run out of trumps)
  - Revealing non-trump cards when a player goes cold
  - Managing trick leadership and turn rotation

  ## Finnish Pidro Playing Rules

  ### Card Playing
  - Only trump cards can be played (non-trumps are "camouflage")
  - Players must play a trump card if they have one
  - The highest trump card wins the trick
  - The trick winner leads the next trick

  ### Going "Cold"
  - A player whose turn comes with no trump to play goes "cold" (eliminated)
    there and then, and the turn moves on; playing a last trump does not
  - Their remaining non-trump cards are revealed to all players
  - They no longer participate in the remaining tricks
  - Their team can still win points through their partner

  ### Trick Completion
  - A trick is complete when all non-eliminated players have played
  - Points are awarded to the winning team based on card values
  - The trick winner leads the next trick

  ## Examples

      # Play a card from a player's hand

  Plays a card from a player's hand during the playing phase.

  This function validates that the card play is legal, removes the card from
  the player's hand, adds it to the current trick, and updates the turn order.
  If the trick is complete after this play, it automatically completes the trick.

  ## Parameters
  - `state` - Current game state
  - `position` - Position of the player playing the card
  - `card` - The card to play

  ## Returns
  - `{:ok, state}` - Updated state with card played
  - `{:error, reason}` - If the play is invalid

  ## State Changes
  - Removes card from player's hand
  - Adds play to current trick
  - Advances turn to next player (or trick leader if trick complete)
  - Records `{:card_played, position, card}` event
  - A player the turn reaches with no trumps goes cold and the turn moves on
  - If trick is complete, determines winner and awards points

  ## Validation
  - Game must be in `:playing` phase
  - Trump suit must be declared
  - Card must be in player's hand
  - Card must be a trump card (Finnish variant rule)

  ## Parameters
  - `state` - Current game state with a complete trick

  ## Returns
  - `{:ok, state}` - Updated state with trick completed
  - `{:error, reason}` - If trick cannot be completed

  - Moves current_trick to tricks history

  ## Trick Winner Determination
  - The highest trump card wins
