defmodule Pidro.Bot.Rulebook do
  @moduledoc """
  The rulebook bot: one entry point from a seat view to a legal move.

  `decide/2` dispatches on the phase to `Pidro.Bot.Bidding` or
  `Pidro.Bot.Play` and returns the action with a one-sentence reason. It is
  deterministic: the same view and legal actions always give the same move
  and reason, and no rule draws a random number.

  Every decision is guarded. If the legal actions have a shape the rules do
  not expect, a rule raises, or a rule returns a move that is not legal, the
  bot falls back to the safest legal move (`fallback/2`): it passes, or plays
  its lowest non-point card, never a random one.

  The dealer's rob and the kill stay with the engine's own selection, so in
  `:second_deal` the `{:select_hand, :choose_6_cards}` marker is returned
  unchanged for the caller to resolve.

  ## Supported variant

  Finnish Pidro only, the one rule set the engine implements. The bot takes
  ranking, trump membership and scoring from the engine and keeps only
  tactical preferences and bidding estimates of its own (see
  `Pidro.Bot.Knowledge`). A second rule set needs its own policy, not a
  branch in the server.
