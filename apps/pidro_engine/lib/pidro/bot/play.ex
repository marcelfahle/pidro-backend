defmodule Pidro.Bot.Play do
  @moduledoc """
  How the rulebook bot chooses a card.

  Following and leading each have an ordered list of rules. The first rule
  that applies picks the card and says why; the last rule always applies.
  The rules look at the partner only as a seat, so the bot plays the same
  conventions with a human or a bot partner.

  Finnish Pidro only; see `Pidro.Bot.Rulebook` for the supported-variant
  contract.

  ## Following

  1. Only one legal card: play it.
  2. The trick is safe for the bot's side: feed it a Five, off-Five first,
     otherwise play the lowest card.
  3. An opponent's Five is on an unsafe trick and the bot's highest trump
     beats the current winner: play that trump.
  4. Partner is winning a trick that holds points but is not safe: play the
     lowest card that makes it safe, if there is one.
  5. The opponents are winning a trick that holds points and the bot can
     beat them: play the lowest card that wins.
  6. Otherwise play the lowest non-point card, then the 2, then the lowest
     point card, a Five last.

  ## Leading

  1. Only Fives in hand: lead the off-Five before the Five.
  2. On the bidding side, with a top trump nothing can beat: lead it, except
     the Ace on the opening lead from fewer than four trumps without the King,
     and never a Five while another card is held.
  3. Otherwise lead the lowest non-point trump, then the 2, then the lowest
     point card that is not a Five.
