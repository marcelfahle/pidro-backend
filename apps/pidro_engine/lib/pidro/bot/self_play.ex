defmodule Pidro.Bot.SelfPlay do
  @moduledoc """
  Plays whole games between two bot teams through the engine and reports
  how each team did.

  A policy is a function from a seat view and the legal actions to an
  action. The harness builds the view for the seat to move, so every policy
  it runs is held to the same fairness rule as a seated bot.

  Games are seeded and each runs in its own process, so a run with the same
  seed gives the same summary. Team A sits North/South in even-numbered
  games and East/West in odd ones. A game ends in one of:

  - `:complete` - a team reached the winning score
  - `{:illegal_action, position, action}` - a policy chose a move that was not legal
  - `{:crash, message}` - a policy raised or the engine rejected a legal move
  - `:stalled` - the seat to move had no legal action
  - `:capped` - the game passed the action cap

  Only complete games count towards win rates. Anything else is a failure the
  release gate refuses.

  Plays a series of games between team A and team B and summarises them.

  ## Options

  - `:games` - number of unpaired games (default 100)
  - `:pairs` - play each seed twice with teams swapped; mutually exclusive with `:games`
  - `:seed` - base seed (default 1); game `i` uses seed `seed * 100_000 + i`
  - `:variant` - game rules (default `:finnish`)
  - `:a`, `:b` - `{label, policy}` for each team (default rulebook vs random)
  - `:max_actions` - per-game action cap
  - `:max_concurrency` - games played at once (default: online schedulers)

  ## Returns

  A summary map with, per label, games won, win rate, contracts won, bids
  made and set, made rate (also without forced dealer bids), and average
  bid; plus counts of illegal moves, crashes, stalls and capped games, and
  per-label decision times under `:timing`. Five metrics count cards, not
  points: captured includes own Fives kept, taken means an opposing Five
  captured, and lost means an own Five captured by the opponents. Only
  completed tricks count, including completed tricks in failed games.

  Auction metrics use scored hands only. Opportunities count turns facing
  an opponent's standing 6 or 7, or a partner's standing bid. Raises count
  bids on those turns, even if later outbid. A partner raise's made rate
  counts only raises that won the contract, not those later outbid. The
  forced-dealer-6 share uses all scored hands as its denominator.

  Paired runs also include each pair's seed and winners, sweep/split counts
  and incomplete pairs. Pairing fixes cuts and deck order per hand; different
  trump choices and game lengths can still yield different hands. It does
  not promise identical random-policy choices after play diverges.
