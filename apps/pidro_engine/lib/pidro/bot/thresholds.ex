defmodule Pidro.Bot.Thresholds do
  @moduledoc """
  Every constant the rulebook bot bids by, in one place.

  A suit's bid estimate sums sure points, the held Fives weighted by how
  protected they are, half-credit for the Jack and Ten, a bonus for holding
  the top trumps, and a bonus for the dealer. Finnish adds trump length and
  an allowance to contest cheap opposing bids. Louisiana keeps the original
  estimate and partner margin.

  The original calibration valued a protected Five at 3 and gave one top
  trump control credit from three trumps. PID-271 tuned length, competition
  and partner raises on paired self-play (seed 271), then checked fresh seeds
  272 and 273: 51.9% and 52.4% wins against the original bidder. Four updated
  seats made 75.8% of contracts versus 76.5% before. The half-point competition
  allowance kept nearly all the gain of larger margins with fewer sets.

  @doc """
  Returns the value of one bidding constant.

  - `:ace`, `:two` - sure points for holding the Ace or the 2 of the suit
  - `:jack_or_ten` - half-credit for each of the Jack and the Ten
  - `:five_protected` / `:five_unprotected` - value of each held Five
  - `:five_protection_trumps` - trumps held, the Five included, that protect it
  - `:five_protection_trumps_with_honour` - the same with the Ace or King held
  - `:control_ace_king` - bonus for the Ace and King together
  - `:control_one_honour` - bonus for one of them with enough length
  - `:control_one_honour_min_trumps` - the length that bonus needs
  - `:dealer_bonus` - added when the bidder is the dealer, who robs the pack
  - `:trump_length` / `:trump_length_cap` - Finnish bonus per trump beyond two,
    capped to avoid double-counting the protection and control bonuses
  - `:cheap_contract_margin` - Finnish allowance below the next bid when
    contesting an opponent's 6 or 7; never applied over a partner
  - `:overbid_partner_margin` - how far above partner's bid the estimate must
    reach before the Finnish bot overbids partner (Louisiana keeps two)
