## Quick Start

### Installation

Add to your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pidro_engine, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

### Play in IEx

```bash
cd apps/pidro_engine
iex -S mix
```

```elixir
# Import the IEx helpers
import Pidro.IEx

# Create a new game (dealer selected, ready for bidding)
state = new_game()

# View the game state beautifully formatted
pretty_print(state)

# See what actions are available
show_legal_actions(state, :west)

# Make a move
{:ok, state} = step(state, :west, {:bid, 10})

# Continue playing...
{:ok, state} = step(state, :north, :pass)
{:ok, state} = step(state, :east, {:bid, 11})

# Run an automated demo game
demo_game()
```

### Use the Game Engine

```elixir
alias Pidro.Game.Engine
alias Pidro.Core.GameState

# Create a new game
{:ok, state} = Engine.new_game()

# Get legal actions for a position
actions = Engine.legal_actions(state, :north)

# Apply an action
{:ok, new_state} = Engine.apply_action(state, :north, {:bid, 8})

# Check game phase
state.phase  # :bidding, :playing, :scoring, etc.
```

### Use the OTP Server

```elixir
# Start a supervised game
{:ok, pid} = Pidro.Supervisor.start_game("game-123")

# Apply actions through the server
{:ok, state} = Pidro.Server.apply_action(pid, :north, {:bid, 8})

# Get current state
state = Pidro.Server.get_state(pid)

# Check if game is over
Pidro.Server.game_over?(pid)
```

## Game Rules Overview

Finnish Pidro is a trick-taking card game for 4 players in 2 teams:

- **Teams**: North/South vs East/West (partners sit opposite)
- **Initial Deal**: 9 cards per player
- **Bidding**: Players bid 6-14 points (or pass)
- **Trump Declaration**: Bid winner declares trump suit
- **Redeal**: Non-trump cards discarded, players dealt to 6 cards
- **Dealer Rob**: Dealer combines hand + remaining deck, selects best 6
- **Kill Rule**: Players with >6 trump must discard non-point cards
- **Play**: Only trump cards can be played
- **Going Cold**: Players with no trumps are eliminated from the hand
- **Scoring**: 14 points per hand, first team to 62 wins

### Point Cards

- **Ace**: 1 point
- **Jack**: 1 point
- **10**: 1 point
- **Right 5** (5 of trump): 5 points
- **Wrong 5** (5 of same-color suit): 5 points
- **2**: 1 point

**Total**: 14 points per hand

### Trump Ranking

A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > Right-5 > Wrong-5 > 4 > 3 > 2

## Architecture

### Core Modules

## Property-Based Testing

This engine uses extensive property-based testing with StreamData to ensure correctness:

### Core Properties

- Deck always contains exactly 52 cards
- Trump ranking is transitive and deterministic
- Right 5 always beats Wrong 5
- Point distribution is always exactly 14 per hand

### Game Flow Properties

- Phases transition in correct order
- Exactly 4 players in two opposing teams
- Dealer rotates correctly between hands
- Bidding completes with valid winner

### Redeal Mechanics Properties

- Dealer combines hand + deck before selecting 6
- Non-dealers receive correct number of cards
- Kill rule enforces non-point trump discards
- Top killed card forced as first play

See [guides/property_testing.md](guides/property_testing.md) for details.

## Event Sourcing

Every game action produces events that can be replayed:

```elixir
# Get event history
events = state.events

# Replay from events
{:ok, replayed_state} = Pidro.Game.Replay.replay(events)

# Undo last action
{:ok, previous_state} = Pidro.Game.Replay.undo(state)

# Export to PGN notation
pgn = Pidro.Notation.encode(state)

# Import from PGN
{:ok, imported_state} = Pidro.Notation.decode(pgn)
```

See [guides/event_sourcing.md](guides/event_sourcing.md) for details.

## Performance

- **Card operations**: < 1μs
- **State hashing**: < 10μs
- **Move generation**: 2x+ speedup with cache
- **Full hand simulation**: ~50ms
- **Event replay**: ~100ms for complete game

Benchmark with:

```bash
mix run bench/pidro_benchmark.exs
```

## Implementation Status

- ✅ **Phase 0-11**: Core engine, event sourcing, performance layer, OTP wrapper
- ✅ **Redeal Mechanics**: Full Finnish variant with kill rules
- ✅ **Property Testing**: 157 properties covering all game phases
- ✅ **IEx Helpers**: Complete interactive development tools
- ❌ **Phase 12**: Phoenix LiveView UI (future work)

**Completion**: 11/12 phases (92%)
