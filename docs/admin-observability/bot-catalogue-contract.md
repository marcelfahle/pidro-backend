# Bot catalogue contract

Status: draft integration handoff, 2026-10-22. Feature branch
`admin-ops/bot-catalogue`; not a claim of review readiness or deployment.
GameDetailLive and card_components belong to the separate Watch branch.

## Public HTTP API

`GET /api/v1/bots` is additive and does not require authentication. Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "marcel",
      "name": "Marcel",
      "description": "",
      "avatar_url": "https://BACKEND_ORIGIN/images/bots/marcel.svg"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each entry contains **only** `id`, `name`, `description`, `avatar_url`.
All are strings; description can be empty. IDs are opaque, immutable strings:
legacy IDs remain exactly `marcel`, `antti`, `jocke`; new profiles receive a
server-generated UUID string. Do not enumerate persona IDs in client code.
Catalogue reads include disabled profiles so seated identities still resolve.
There is no public enabled flag, strategy key, module name, process identifier,
image bytes, admin identity, user account, or rating in a profile.

Use backend-origin absolute `avatar_url` as returned. Do not derive a URL from
an arbitrary ID or fetch a user-provided remote URL. URLs use the endpoint's
configured public origin, as existing user avatars do.

## Optional additions to existing payloads

Existing `bot_persona` remains a string or null. It is a persona ID, **not**
the `bot_ROOM_position` player/seat identifier and not difficulty.

Serialized seats (including game channel room snapshots and room/readiness
HTTP projections) gain optional `bot_profile`:

```json
{
  "occupant_type": "bot",
  "bot_persona": "marcel",
  "bot_profile": {
    "id": "marcel",
    "name": "Marcel",
    "description": "",
    "avatar_url": "https://BACKEND_ORIGIN/images/bots/marcel.svg"
  }
}
```

Human/vacant seats and human-replacement substitutes have `bot_profile: null`.
Human replacements retain existing reservation/identity semantics; do not label
them as a catalogue persona merely because control is automated.

Room HTTP seat projections additionally populate existing `username`,
`display_name`, `avatar_url` from the catalogue for persona bots. Lobby seat
`player` summaries carry `bot_persona`, the same optional `bot_profile`, and
existing `username`, `display_name`, `avatar_url` with authoritative profile
values. Existing `player.id` and room `positions` identifiers are unchanged.
No strategy field is added to public seats or lobby summaries.

All additions are optional from a client's perspective: older servers omit
them, older builds ignore them. Existing native builds keep their built-in
legacy drawings; no native dependency/build is required to add a profile on
the server. Following clients should prefer `bot_profile`, then an entry in
`GET /api/v1/bots` matching `bot_persona`, then the fallback below.

## Portrait assets and fallback

Built-in static URLs, on the backend public origin:

- `/images/bots/marcel.svg`
- `/images/bots/antti.svg`
- `/images/bots/jocke.svg`

These are faithful static exports of
`pidrogame/pidro-frontend/packages/mobile/src/components/ui/BotPersonaFace.tsx`
at commit `df95bb8b6845f738cc669d840f17f51b86b4eb08`, not new illustrations.
Provenance/export details are in
`apps/pidro_server/priv/static/images/bots/README.md`. They preserve the source
square viewBox; consumers apply the existing circular avatar crop.

Uploaded portraits are normalized JPEG, served publicly at
`GET /api/v1/bots/:id/avatar/:sha256`, `Content-Type: image/jpeg`, `nosniff`,
immutable one-year caching. Wrong/noncurrent versions return 404. Replacing an
upload changes its hash/URL; re-fetch profile metadata rather than modifying
URLs. Only the current upload is retained. Built-in SVGs are trusted tracked
assets, never user-uploaded SVGs.

**Unknown persona contract:** an absent/unresolvable profile yields
`bot_profile: null`; display name is `Bot` and avatar is null in enriched
projections. Clients must accept any string ID without throwing. If metadata
is absent, preserve the existing artwork/name fallback for the three known
legacy IDs; for any other ID show a neutral bot/avatar placeholder and `Bot`.
An image fetch failure must show that placeholder, not break the seat/table.
Do not invent an SVG path from the unknown ID or show an internal seat ID.

## Allocation and lifetime

- Room crew order remains seeded/shuffled; allocation filters disabled IDs,
  incorporates newly added enabled IDs, and chooses an unused identity first.
- With four enabled profiles, four seats have four distinct persona IDs. When
  the enabled pool is exhausted, the first eligible persona can repeat.
- With no enabled profiles, or before the new table is migrated, allocation
  falls back to the original three IDs in deterministic legacy input order
  (the existing room shuffle still applies). Games do not fail for an empty
  catalogue. The public catalogue still resolves those legacy IDs.
- Disabling/renaming a profile does not remove or change a seated persona ID.
  Profile presentation is current catalogue metadata on subsequent snapshots;
  strategy is captured separately when seated and never read from a public
  payload. Process reattachment and rematch keep that seat's persona/strategy.
- Catalogue changes notify connected catalogue admin views. They do not emit
  a new game/lobby roster event by themselves; clients can re-fetch catalogue
  metadata, and subsequent normal room snapshots use current profile data.
- No bot persona is inserted into users, ratings, progression or auth tables.

## Admin contract

`/admin/bots` uses existing authenticated admin sessions and password-change
gates, including event-time session revalidation. It also refuses the local
development auth bypass: editing requires a real admin account.

The LiveView supports list/add/edit and disabling (no hard delete). The stable
ID is read-only; form input cannot set it. Fields:

- `bot[name]`: required, max 60 characters.
- `bot[description]`: public text, max 500 characters, empty allowed.
- `bot[enabled]`: boolean, controls only new assignments.
- `bot[strategy]`: allowlisted `rulebook` (production default) or `random`
  (existing RandomStrategy), affects newly seated bots only. No dynamic atoms
  or module names accepted. Legacy difficulty values still resolve to the
  production rulebook, as before; persona identity is not difficulty.
- `bot[portrait]`: `marcel`, `antti`, `jocke`, or `upload` when one exists.
- LiveView upload `avatar`: one PNG/JPEG, at most 5 MiB. Signature-checked;
  maximum 8192px side and 16 megapixels; reused bounded ImageMagick normalizer
  strips metadata, crops to 256×256 JPEG, and caps the output at 64 KiB.
  A successful upload selects `upload`. No executable SVG, arbitrary remote
  URLs, or server-side URL fetching. Invalid replacement leaves saved data
  unchanged.

## Migration and integration

Migration `20261022120000_create_bot_profiles` adds only its own table and
strategy constraint. Seeds use fixed legacy IDs with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
No existing user/room/game table is changed; down drops only bot_profiles.
Migrate before serving catalogue administration. Application startup tolerates
an absent catalogue table and serves legacy fallback; after migration restart
the application or open `/admin/bots` to refresh its node-local snapshot.
Admin writes refresh that snapshot and distribute profile metadata via PubSub;
game action/seat serialization paths do not query the database per seat.

The coordinator should integrate backend assets/context before Watch/client
consumers. Frontend work is separate; this backend branch does not change
React/Expo types or views. Verification and remaining limitations will be
recorded in `docs/admin-observability/bot-catalogue.md` before review-ready.
