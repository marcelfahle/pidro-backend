# Pidro

A card game you've probably never heard of. Unless you're from the Midwest. Then you definitely have.

This is an attempt to build the whole thing with [Ralph](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) - because apparently the future of coding is talking to AI agents who argue with you less than your co-founder would.

Built with Phoenix + Elixir because if you're going to build a multiplayer card game, you might as well do it on the platform that can handle millions of concurrent connections.
